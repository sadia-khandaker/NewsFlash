## Description

### Introduction

NewsFlash is a social media web application that respects its users' desire for privacy, freedom of speech, and communal
support. NewsFlash is an innovative and liberating space for people to share their voices in a world where they are frequently
silenced or censored for doing so.

### Mission Statement

NewsFlash's mission is to upend the status quo of traditional social media platforms by unleashing the full potential of
self-expression and empowering individuals to freely share their thoughts, opinions, and insider news without societal
pressure or fear of criticism. NewsFlash provides a personalized and one-of-a-kind experience with features such as verified
user identification, anonymity settings, group chats, post scheduling, and customizable profiles.

NewsFlash pushes the boundaries of traditional social media platforms, where opinions and thoughts are frequently suppressed,
by prioritizing privacy and anonymity. Say goodbye to the hassle of managing multiple profiles and hello to the freedom
to express yourself authentically and openly without fear of having your voice silenced or your privacy violated.

## Features

### NoFlash - The Anonymous Experience

NewsFlash's NoFlash feature allows users to post anonymously, without the fear of being identified or having their posts
censored. Users can choose to post anonymously or with their identity, and can switch between the two at any time.
NoFlash is a great way to share your thoughts and opinions without the fear of being judged or criticized by others.

### Community Building

NewsFlash's community building features allow users to connect with others who share similar interests and values. Users can
create and join groups, and can chat with other users in real-time. Users can also follow other users to stay up-to-date
on their posts and activities.

### Verified Users

NewsFlash's verified user feature allows users to verify their identity and gain access to exclusive features. A new user can
create an account by providing personal information, such as their name, email, and password, and by confirming their
identity through a verification email. Once a user's identity is verified, they can access exclusive features such as
the ability to post anonymously, and the ability to create and join groups. In other words, "Say it all, stay
incognito."

### Customizable Profiles

NewsFlash's customizable profiles allow users to express themselves and showcase their interests. Users can customize their
profile with their name, profile picture, and bio. Users can also choose to display their name and profile picture on
their posts, or to remain anonymous.

## Technologies

NewsFlash is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and Firebase. The frontend is built using React,

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.
